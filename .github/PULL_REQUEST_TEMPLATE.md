## Risks

What could break or what was riskiest to change?

<!-- Describe any areas of concern. -->

---

## Checks run

- [ ] `npm run lint`
- [ ] `npm run type-check`
- [ ] `npm run test`
- [ ] `npm run test:e2e:smoke` (or `npm run test:all`)

---

## Evidence

Screenshots or sample audit log rows (or "N/A – no UI/audit change").

<!-- Paste or link evidence where relevant. -->

---

## Tests (for non-trivial changes)

For any change beyond trivial (e.g. font/color): confirm you reviewed existing tests for the affected area; list tests added or updated and why (e.g. contract test, regression, new scenario), or note why no test change was needed.

<!-- Example: "Reviewed schedule API tests; added test for conflict resolution payload. No test change needed – styling only." -->
